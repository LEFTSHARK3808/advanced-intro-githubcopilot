# Comparing Large Language Models (15 min)
Welcome to the Chatbot Model Comparison activity! Here, you will compare the output of three different chatbot models. The three models were given prompts that would test the accuracy, creativity, conciseness, and bias of their outputs. Your job is to select the model that performed best in each category. Let's get started!

Complete the activity [here](https://igfnaqfcyl-13589482-i.codehs.me/index.html).  Then edit this page and write down your reflections here:

### Which model did you find performed best overall, and why?
[GPT4 was the most concise and the one that made the most sense to me. 

### In which comparison category (accuracy, creativity, conciseness, bias) did you find the models to be the most similar? What about the most different?
I think that most of the Ais were accurate enough however the llama ai was very long winded in most of its responses

### Were you surprised by any of the results?
The Llama ai was the longest one

### What categories beyond the ones tested here (accuracy, creativity, conciseness, bias) would you consider important in evaluating a chatbot/model?
Bias because it can change people's opionions.
